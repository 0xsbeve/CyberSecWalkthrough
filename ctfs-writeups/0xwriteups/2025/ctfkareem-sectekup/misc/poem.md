# POEM

### Given Text File

```
Poetry is a lovely thing,
back in the early days 
peoples used to share data
through poems is it the case?

Silent Trails Echo Gentle Air,
Nightâ€™s Owls In Moonlight Sing.
Over Waves, Serenity Awaits,
In Dreams, A Mind Ascends.
Zephyr Invites New Growth.
Amidst Zealous Inspirations,
Never-ending Gratitude.
```
