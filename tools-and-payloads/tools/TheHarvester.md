4.  **`-f <file_name>` / `--file=<file_name>`:** Output results to an HTML or XML file.
    *   **Example:** `theharvester -d example.com -f output.html`

5.  **`-v` / `--verbose`:** Enables verbose output for more information during the gathering.
    *   **Example:** `theharvester -d example.com -v`

6. **`-n` / `--dns`:** Perform a dns lookup on the discovered subdomains.
   * **Example:** `theharvester -d example.com -n`

7.  **`-h` / `--takeover`:** Identify potential subdomain takeover vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** `theharvester -d example.com -h`

8.  **`-p` / `--portscan`:** Perform a basic port scan on the discovered hosts.
     *  **Example:** `theharvester -d example.com -p`

9. **`-s` / `--shodan`:** Use the Shodan API to gather additional information on discovered hosts.
